# CTF-Planner

> [!NOTE]
> This is a small android mobile application which I coded as I didn't find an app which met my requirements. <br/>
> The app leverages the [CTFtime-API](https://ctftime.org/api/) to fetch livedata. Additionally it includes a builtin calendar to plan upcoming events. <br/>
> (There might still be minor bugs in the application)

## Overview

The app consists of 4 differents tabs. <br/>
